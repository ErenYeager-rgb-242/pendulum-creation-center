# pendulum-creation-center
I am working on an art project and I would love to see people experimenting with their own creative style on a simple base. Your canvas is a plain pendulum obeying to the laws of gravity and I want to see how you would go around making it prettier, scarier or anything you have in mind. Feel free to experiment on my code as needed.
